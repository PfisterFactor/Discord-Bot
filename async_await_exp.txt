async is a keyword that indicates that this function can run 
asynchronously. await tells the program that it can do other 
things in the meantime while waiting on this command, which is
 helpful if the given code might take a while or if the program 
 will need to wait for the command to execute. The rule of thumb 
 is that if you want to call an async function, then you should 
 await before calling it. If your function uses await in the body, 
 you add async to the function signature.

Async+Await combo means we can run this command and then suspend it to
 do other things and come back. This type of programming is a key 
 concept in computer science called concurrency, and itâ€™s a pretty
  complicated idea. Here are some links so that you can learn more
   about it: Python docs - asyncio and Real Python - Async IO.
